Lucid Keystone is a custom Mythic+ timer for an advanced display of various timers, deaths and progress. Furthermore, the addon is also designed to display advanced statistics about the finished keystones.

No matter if you have just started with "Mythic Plus" or if you have been with it for a long time. Display only what is important to you personally for Mythic Plus.

The statistics show you exactly which keys you can improve or how well you have completed the respective keys.
